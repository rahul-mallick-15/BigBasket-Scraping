# BigBasket-Scraping
Scraps product details from BigBasket's website

This projects uses puppeteer to scrap product details from BigBasket's website.<br>

# Approach
For Scraping the site, I have used a generalized approach of looping through all levels of categories starting with the highest level.<br>
Once the product details are fetched I'm storing them in a JSON file first.<br>
Then using the JSON file I'm writing the data into a google sheet.
